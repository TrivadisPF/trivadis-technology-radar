[Trino](https://trino.io/) is a distributed SQL query engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous data sources.

Trino was previously named PrestoSQL but due to a competing fork of Presto called PrestoDB, the project has been renamed to Trino in December 2020.
