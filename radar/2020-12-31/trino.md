[Trino](https://trino.io/) is a distributed SQL query engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous data sources.

Trino was previously known as PrestoSQL but due to a competing fork of Presto called PrestoDB, [PrestoSQL has been rebranded as Trino](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html) in December 2020.
