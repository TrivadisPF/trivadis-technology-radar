[StreamSets DataOps Platform]() is an end-to-end data integration platform to build, run, monitor and manage smart data pipelines. 

It is the replacement offer of StreamSets for the open source [StreamSets Data Collector](./platforms-and-services/streamsets-datacollector.html), which is no longer actively developed.
