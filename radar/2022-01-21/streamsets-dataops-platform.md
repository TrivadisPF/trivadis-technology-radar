[StreamSets DataOps Platform](https://streamsets.com/products/dataops-platform/) is an end-to-end data integration platform to build, run, monitor and manage smart data pipelines. 

It is the replacement offer of StreamSets for the open source [StreamSets Data Collector](./streamsets-datacollector.html), which is no longer actively developed.
