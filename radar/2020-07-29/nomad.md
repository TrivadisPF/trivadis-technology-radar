[Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) is a simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers and non-containerized applications across on-prem and clouds at scale.

While [Kubernetes](../platforms-and-services/kubernetes.html) is specifically focused on Docker, Nomad is more general purpose. Nomad supports virtualized, containerized and standalone applications, including Docker.
