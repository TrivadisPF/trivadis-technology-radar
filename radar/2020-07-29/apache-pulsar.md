[Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging system originally created at Yahoo and now part of the Apache Software Foundation.

It has some features which are not (yet) available in Apache Kafka and therefore it is worth to have a look at Apache Pulsar.
