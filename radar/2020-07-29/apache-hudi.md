[Apache Hudi](https://iceberg.apache.org/) ingests & manages storage of large analytical datasets over DFS (hdfs or cloud stores)

Apache Hudi would be interesting to try out as an alternative to [Delta Lake](../languages-and-frameworks/delta-lake.html) and [Apache Iceberg](../languages-and-frameworks/apache-iceberg.html).
