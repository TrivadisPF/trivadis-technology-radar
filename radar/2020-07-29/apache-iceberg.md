[Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. Iceberg adds tables to Presto and Spark that use a high-performance format that works just like a SQL table.

Apache Iceberg is interesting as it is the favorite of Dremio and will soon be supported by Presto.
