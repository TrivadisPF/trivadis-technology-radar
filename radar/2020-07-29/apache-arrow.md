[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs. The Arrow memory format also supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead.

Apache Arrow is the foundation behind Dremio and therefore it would be interesting to have a look at it.
