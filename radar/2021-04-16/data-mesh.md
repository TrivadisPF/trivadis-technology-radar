[Data mesh](https://datameshlearning.com) is a new approach based on a modern, distributed architecture for analytical data management. It enables end users to easily access and query data where it lives without necessarily first transporting it to a data lake or data warehouse. The decentralized strategy of data mesh distributes data ownership to domain-specific teams that manage, own, and serve the data as a product.
