[Delta Lake](delta.io) is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Sparkâ„¢ and big data workloads.

Data lakes typically have multiple data pipelines reading and writing data concurrently, and data engineers have to go through a tedious process to ensure data integrity, due to the lack of transactions. Delta Lake brings ACID transactions to your data lakes. It provides serializability, the strongest level of isolation level. Learn more at Diving into Delta Lake: Unpacking the Transaction Log.
