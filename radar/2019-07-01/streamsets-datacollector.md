[StreamSets Data Collector](https://streamsets.com/products/dataops-platform/data-collector/) s a lightweight, powerful design and execution engine that streams data in real time. Use Data Collector to route and process data in your data streams. 

StreamSets Data Collector Edge on the other hand is a lightweight execution agent without a UI that runs pipelines on edge devices. Use SDC Edge to read data from an edge device or to receive data from another pipeline and then act on that data to control an edge device.
