[Domain-driven design (DDD)](https://martinfowler.com/tags/domain%20driven%20design.html) is the concept that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes such as LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.
