  "__content": "\n\n[Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. Iceberg adds tables to Presto and Spark that use a high-performance format that works just like a SQL table.\n\nApache Hudi would be interesting to try out as an alternative to [Delta Lake](../languages-and-frameworks/delta-lake.html) and [Apache Hudi](../languages-and-frameworks/apache-hudi.html). \n\nApache Iceberg is interesting as it is the favourite of [Dremio](../languages-and-frameworks/dremio.html) and will soon be supported by [Presto](../languages-and-frameworks/presto.html)."
